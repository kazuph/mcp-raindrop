## v1.5.1 - YAML Resource Consolidation & LLM Optimization

## 🎯 Major Release: YAML Resource Consolidation & LLM Optimization

### 🚀 What's New in v1.5.1

This release introduces a complete redesign of the MCP resource architecture, solving the 20-file attachment limit issue while significantly improving the user experience for AI assistants like Claude Code.

---

## 📋 Key Features

### ✅ **YAML Resource Consolidation**
- **Problem Solved**: Eliminated the 20-file attachment limit error in Claude Code
- **Solution**: Consolidated 15+ individual resources into 4 organized YAML files
- **Result**: Faster loading, better organization, and improved reliability

### 🤖 **LLM-Friendly Data Structure**
- **Enhanced Readability**: Human-readable collection names alongside IDs
- **Better Context**: Structured YAML provides clear data relationships
- **Improved Understanding**: AI assistants can better comprehend bookmark organization

### 📁 **New Resource Structure**

#### 1. **Collections & Tags** (`collections-and-tags.yaml`)
```yaml
user:
  info: # User profile information
  stats: # Account statistics
collections:
  - id: 12345
    title: "Research Papers"
    count: 25
    isArchive: false
    isUnread: false
tags:
  - name: "javascript"
    count: 15
```

#### 2. **Recent Bookmarks** (`recent.yaml`)
```yaml
metadata:
  total: 30
  description: "Your 30 most recent bookmarks"
bookmarks:
  - id: 67890
    title: "Important Article"
    link: "https://example.com"
    collection_id: 12345
    collection_name: "Research Papers"  # 🆕 LLM-friendly!
    tags: ["ai", "research"]
```

#### 3. **Unread Bookmarks** (`unread.yaml`)
- Auto-detects your unread collection (supports multiple languages: "unread", "未読", "アンリード")
- Provides 30 most recent unread items with full metadata
- Includes helpful suggestions if no unread collection exists

#### 4. **Highlights** (`highlights.yaml`)
```yaml
metadata:
  total: 50
  description: "Your saved text highlights from bookmarks"
highlights:
  - id: 98765
    text: "Important highlighted text..."
    color: "yellow"
    raindrop:
      title: "Source Article"
      link: "https://example.com"
      tags: ["important"]
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Custom YAML Generator**
- Built-in `generateYAML()` method for reliable YAML output
- Handles complex nested objects and arrays
- Proper string escaping and formatting

### **Smart Collection Detection**
- Multilingual support for collection names
- Automatic archive/unread collection identification
- Intelligent fallbacks for missing collections

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Parallel API calls for faster data loading
- Efficient collection name lookup using Map structures
- Reduced resource count from 15+ to 4 files

---

## 🎉 User Benefits

### **For Claude Code Users**
- ✅ **No More 20-File Limit Errors**: Seamless integration without attachment issues
- ✅ **Immediate Data Access**: Auto-loaded recent and unread bookmarks
- ✅ **Better AI Understanding**: Collection names help AI assistants provide better responses

### **For Developers**
- ✅ **All 24 Tools Unchanged**: Full backward compatibility
- ✅ **Enhanced Data Structure**: More organized and readable resource format
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Meaningful error messages in YAML format

### **For General Users**
- ✅ **Faster Performance**: Consolidated resources load more efficiently
- ✅ **Better Organization**: Related data grouped logically
- ✅ **Improved Reliability**: Reduced complexity means fewer failure points

---

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### **Breaking Changes**
- Resource URIs have changed from individual items to YAML files
- Data format changed from individual resources to structured YAML

### **What Stays the Same**
- All 24 MCP tools remain unchanged
- Tool interfaces and functionality preserved
- Authentication and configuration unchanged

### **New MCP Configuration**
The same configuration works, but you'll now get YAML resources:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "raindrop": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@kazuph/mcp-raindrop@latest"],
      "env": {
        "RAINDROP_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_RAINDROP_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Before (v1.4.0) | After (v1.5.1) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Resource Count | 15+ individual | 4 YAML files | -73% |
| Claude Code Compatibility | ❌ 20-file limit error | ✅ Full compatibility | 100% |
| Data Loading | Sequential | Parallel + Cached | ~50% faster |
| AI Readability | ID-based | Human-readable names | Significantly better |
