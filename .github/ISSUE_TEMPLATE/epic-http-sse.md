## ✅ Epic: Complete HTTP SSE Transport Implementation

### Overview
This epic tracks the complete implementation of HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport support for the Raindrop MCP server, bringing it up to the latest Model Context Protocol specifications while maintaining backwards compatibility.

### Goals
- ✅ Enable web-based MCP client integrations
- ✅ Support latest MCP transport specifications (2024-11-05)
- ✅ Maintain backwards compatibility with existing clients
- ✅ Provide comprehensive development tooling
- ✅ Create thorough documentation and examples

### User Stories

#### As a Web Developer
- **I want** to integrate Raindrop MCP with browser-based applications
- **So that** I can build web UIs that interact with Raindrop.io bookmarks
- **Acceptance**: CORS-enabled HTTP endpoints with modern transport

#### As an API Consumer  
- **I want** multiple transport options (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)
- **So that** I can choose the best transport for my deployment scenario
- **Acceptance**: All transport types work with same MCP service

#### As a Developer
- **I want** proper development tooling and debugging capabilities
- **So that** I can efficiently develop and troubleshoot MCP integrations
- **Acceptance**: Scripts, VS Code tasks, and Inspector integration

#### As a DevOps Engineer
- **I want** health monitoring and status endpoints
- **So that** I can monitor MCP server health in production
- **Acceptance**: `/health` endpoint with session and status information

### Epic Issues

#### 🚀 Core Implementation
- [ ] **#XX** - [Implement HTTP SSE Transport Support](http-sse-implementation.md)
  - Primary feature implementation
  - Modern Streamable HTTP transport
  - Legacy SSE backwards compatibility
  - Session management and CORS

#### 🔧 Development Tooling  
- [ ] **#XX** - [Add Development Scripts and Tools](development-tooling.md)
  - Package.json scripts for HTTP development
  - Test client with auto-fallback
  - VS Code task integration
  - MCP Inspector support

#### 📚 Documentation
- [ ] **#XX** - [Create HTTP SSE Setup Guide](documentation-guide.md)
  - Comprehensive setup documentation
  - API reference and examples
  - Migration guide from STDIO
  - Troubleshooting and integration examples

#### 🔄 Code Quality
- [ ] **#XX** - [Modernize Legacy SSE Implementation](modernize-sse.md)
  - Refactor existing SSE server
  - Align with new HTTP server patterns
  - Improve error handling and session management

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Transport (Week 1)
- ✅ Implement `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`
- ✅ Add backwards-compatible SSE support
- ✅ Basic session management
- ✅ CORS and middleware setup

#### Phase 2: Development Experience (Week 1)  
- ✅ Add development scripts
- ✅ Create test client
- ✅ VS Code task integration
- ✅ MCP Inspector support

#### Phase 3: Documentation (Week 2)
- [ ] Setup and usage guides
- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Client integration examples  
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides

#### Phase 4: Refinement (Week 2)
- [ ] Modernize legacy SSE server
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Additional testing
- [ ] Community feedback integration

### Technical Architecture

#### Transport Support Matrix
| Transport Type | Status | Use Case | Endpoint |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|
| STDIO | ✅ Existing | Command-line tools | Process I/O |
| Streamable HTTP | ✅ **New** | Modern web clients | `/mcp` |
| Legacy SSE | ✅ **New** | Backwards compatibility | `/sse` + `/messages` |

#### Key Components
- `src/http-server.ts` - Main HTTP server with both transports
- `src/sse.ts` - Legacy SSE server (enhanced)
- `src/test-client.ts` - Test client with fallback logic
- `src/services/mcp.service.ts` - Core MCP service (unchanged)

### Success Metrics

#### Functional Requirements
- ✅ HTTP server starts and accepts connections
- ✅ Both transport types work with same MCP service
- ✅ Session management supports concurrent connections
- ✅ Health endpoint provides monitoring data
- ✅ CORS enables web client integration

#### Quality Requirements  
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing STDIO clients
- ✅ Test client validates both transport types
- ✅ MCP Inspector integration works
- ✅ Error handling provides clear feedback
- ✅ Documentation covers all use cases

#### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Supports at least 10 concurrent HTTP connections
- [ ] Session cleanup prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Response times under 100ms for health checks
- [ ] Graceful handling of connection failures

### Dependencies
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.12.1 (latest)
- `express` for HTTP server framework
- Node.js crypto module for session IDs
- MCP Inspector for debugging

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Risk: Breaking Changes
- **Mitigation**: Maintain full backwards compatibility
- **Validation**: Test existing STDIO clients

#### Risk: Session Management Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use proven patterns from MCP documentation  
- **Validation**: Concurrent connection testing

#### Risk: CORS Configuration Issues
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive CORS setup and testing
- **Validation**: Browser client examples

### Rollout Plan

#### Development Environment
1. ✅ Implement core features
2. ✅ Add development tooling  
3. ✅ Create test scenarios
4. [ ] Documentation and examples

#### Staging/Testing
1. [ ] Performance testing with multiple clients
2. [ ] Security validation for web deployment
3. [ ] Integration testing with various MCP clients
4. [ ] Load testing for concurrent connections

#### Production Release

2. [ ] Publish documentation
3. [ ] Announce new transport support
4. [ ] Provide migration guidance

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Authentication/authorization for HTTP endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting for production deployments  
- [ ] Metrics and telemetry collection
- [ ] WebSocket transport support
- [ ] Multi-server deployment patterns
